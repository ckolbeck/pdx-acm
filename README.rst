Portland State ACM
------------------

This is the code repository for Portland State's ACM chapter website. Clearly
this code is very new and experimental. If you try to use it don't always expect
it to work correctly. In other words, YRMV. To install checkout this repo and
run::

  python setup.py develop


As always, we're available for some support in irc @ #acm on the PSU-CAT irc server.
