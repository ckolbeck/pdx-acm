Portland State ACM
==================

This is the code repository for Portland State's ACM chapter website. Clearly
this code is very new and experimental. If you try to use it don't always
expect it to work correctly. In other words, YRMV. To install checkout this repo
and run::

  cabal install

If you're not sure what that means you should get the `Haskell Platform`_
installed and read up on `Cabal`_. In addition, you should visit the
`Snapframework`_ documentation.

As always, we're available for some support in irc @ `#acm`_ on the `PSU-CAT`_
irc server.
