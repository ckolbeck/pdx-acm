 As a student run organization under National ACM guidelines we
 strive to academically, socially, and creatively enrich the lives of our
 members and the student body. We have been known to host events and
 presentations. We also provide tutoring to fellow computer science
 students. We get our funding through tutoring.  We encourge members or
 non-member to help with tutoing which goes towards our activities as well as
 Friday pizza and games.  Currently, we host regular meetings generally
 centered around various types of board games, and light technical nerdery.

 Please feel free to check out the rest of the site, sign up for our mailing
 list, and come to one of our meetings, presentations or events, even if you're
 not sure about becoming a member.

 The club is free to join and is open to anyone.  Participate as much as you'd
 like.

 We are now holding weekly mtgs. with guest member speakers before we meet for
 pizza.

 The following students and faculty are serving as the PSU ACM officers:

 - Advisor - Bart Massey - `bart at cs.pdx.edu`
 - Chair - Cory Kolbeck - `cbeck at cs.pdx.edu`
 - Vice Chair - Dan Colish - `dcolish at cs.pdx.edu`

about = Page(title="about", text="""
The Association for Computing Machinery, or ACM, was founded in
1947 as the world's first scientific and educational computing society. Its
membership is around 83,000 as of 2007. Its headquarters are in New York City.

ACM is organized into over 170 local chapters and 34 Special Interest Groups
(SIGs), through which it conducts most of its activities. Additionally, there
are over 500 college and university chapters. The first student chapter was
founded in 1961 at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

Many of the SIGs, like SIGGRAPH, SIGPLAN and SIGCOMM, sponsor regular
conferences which have become famous as the dominant venue for presenting new
innovations in certain fields. The groups also publish a large number of
specialized journals, magazines, and newsletters.

ACM also sponsors other computer science related events such as the worldwide
ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and has sponsored some
other events such as the chess match between Garry Kasparov and the IBM Deep
Blue computer.

speakers.

relations with grad students, it's casual. Everyone is invited, ACM officers
