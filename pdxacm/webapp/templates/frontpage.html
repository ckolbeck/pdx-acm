 As a student run organization under National ACM guidelines we strive to academically, socially, and creatively enrich the lives of our members and the student body. We have been known to host events and presentations. We also provide tutoring to fellow computer science students. We get our funding through tutoring.  We encourge members or non-member to help with tutoing which goes towards our activities as well as Friday pizza and games.  Currently, we host regular meetings generally centered around various types of board games, and light technical nerdery.

Please feel free to check out the rest of the site, sign up for our mailing list, and come to one of our meetings, presentations or events, even if you're not sure about becoming a member.

The club is free to join and is open to anyone.  Participate as much as you'd like.

We are now holding weekly mtgs. with guest member speakers before we meet for pizza.
