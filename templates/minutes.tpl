#### 6:15 - summer agenda

- three classes offered
- 163 and 202 is only on friday.

the reason is that we were gonna do a popsicle tuesday. Let's make it thursday because more students will be here.

Because we can only spam mcecs once a month, we should recruit speakers NOW. If you happen to run into someone now, let them know we're looking for Fall term speakers.

second breakfast is on tuesdays at 9:30 in the fishbowl. Good way to keep relations with grad students, it's casual. Everyone is invited, ACM officers should make an effort to attend.

carrbs will look into some graphic design possibilities.
